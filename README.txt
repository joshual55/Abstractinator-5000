This project is by Joshua Lamb, Michael Kruse, and David Lawson. Comments at the top of each file detail who coded what portions. Any images wanting to be sorted should be jpg and located in the "images" folder.

Note: CImg does not have native support for jpg images, so using this program with jpgs requires ImageMagick.

The Windows 10 download for ImageMagick can be found at . . .
